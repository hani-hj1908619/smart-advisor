Shakespeare: a theatre of evil is designed to expose students to Shakespeare's darkest plays and Thought. Using contemporary criticism as a point of entry, this course will establish how and why the question of evil is pervasive throughout Shakespeare’s work. No writer has indeed surpassed Shakespeare in capturing the essence of evil. Shakespeare's great evildoers—such as Iago in Othello, Edmund in King Lear, Macbeth, and Claudius in Hamlet—are at once believably human and cosmically representative of a battle between good and evil. Trying to answer ""the question of evil in Shakespeare"" provides an opportunity for glimpsing into the heart of the human condition.  The plays will be both studied as distinguished writing and as scripts for performance as several of them have been reconceived for the big screen. This subject is also at the junction of Literature and  Cinema as well as other art-forms such as paintings of the Renaissance period. The course has as its aim to offer an innovative interdisciplinary analysis of Shakespeare as well as an overview of current philosophical approaches. Finally, the course argues for the critical importance of thinking Shakespeare now.
